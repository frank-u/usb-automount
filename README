This tiny package enables automatically mounting exfat disks
automatically when they are plugged into a machine.  This is slightly
tricky because udev doesn't allow long-lived processes to be started
from udev (and exfat is a fuse (user land) process), so we have to
start a systemd service unit.

The files should be put in the following locations:

/etc/systemd/system/usb-automount@.service
/usr/local/sbin/usb-automount
/etc/udev/rules.d/90-usb-automount.rules

This works for me on Debian jessie as of Sat Jul 16 20:16:47 CEST
2016, but the udev/systemd people will probably change something
during the next few minutes that will make this all break again.
